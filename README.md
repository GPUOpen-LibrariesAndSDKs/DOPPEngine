# DOPPEngine

DOPPEngine demonstrates how to utilize the Display Output Post-Processing (DOPP) to create various effects manipulating the desktop before it is displayed. 

**The following effects can be selected:**
* **Eyefinity Landscape / Portrait** can be used to divide an SLS surface horizontally or vertically and rotate the respective portion 180Â°. This allows multi-display users with panels having a narrow bezel or being bezeless on the left, right and top side to create a near seamless surface.

* **Invert Colors** displays the desktop with inverted colors
* **Edge Filter** uses an edge detection shader based on laplacian edge detection to highlight the edges on the screen
* **Distort** applies a shader that dynamically distorts the captured screen
* **Rotate** lets you select an angle by which the desktop gets rotated
