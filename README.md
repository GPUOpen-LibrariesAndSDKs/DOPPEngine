# DOPPEngine

DOPPEngine demonstrates how to utilize the Display Output Post-Processing (DOPP) to create various effects manipulating the desktop before it is displayed. The following effects can be selected:
* **Invert Colors** displays the desktop with inverted colors
* **Edge Filter** uses an edge detection shader based on laplacian edge detection to highlight the edges on the screen
* **Distort** applies a shader that dynamically distorts the captured screen
* **Rotate** lets you select an angle by which the desktop gets rotated
* **Eyefinity Landscape / Portrait** can be used to set up a seamless eyefinity surface with a configuration of multiple monitors that have a big border at one side by rotating the upper or left part of the desktop.
